    "There is a T-shirt manufacturer. They produce two kinds of T-shirts. One is a T-shirt that is made of silk. The other is one that is made of cotton. Silk T-shirts per item sells for $45 and costs $30 to make. The cotton T-shirt per item sells for $20 and costs $10. To meet customer demand, at least 2000 units of silk T-shirts and at least 8000 units of cotton T-shirts need to be produced and sold. The manufacturer can produce 8000 units of two kinds of T-shirts at most. What is the maximum revenue that the manufacture can make?"
